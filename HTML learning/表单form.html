				FOXULEE PHOTOGRAPHY 
				Contract for Photography Services  
				1.   Parties.   This is a legal agreement (“Agreement”) entered into on ____/_____/____ (“Effective 
				Date”) between Foxulee Photography (Jialei Hu) (“Photographer”) and 
				________________________________________ (“Client”).    
				2.   Services.  Photographer agrees to provide certain photography services (“Services”) to Client.  
				Specifically, Photographer will provide Services to Client as follows:
				a.   Session Date: _____________________________________________________ 
				b.   Session Time: _______________AM  /  PM  (circle one) 
				c.    Session Location: __________________________________________________ 
				d.   Person(s) to be Photographed (include Client, if applicable): 
				___________________________________________________________________________
				___________________________________________________________________________ 
				e.    Special Notes (if any):  
				___________________________________________________________________________
				___________________________________________________________________________ 
				3.   Payment and Delivery Date.   Client will pay Photographer $   200    (“Total Amount”) for 
				Services.    Client will pay a non-refundable deposit of $50 (“Deposit”) to hold the session 
				date/time.  This Deposit will count toward the Total Amount, and is due at the time this contract 
				is signed.  The remainder of the Total Amount is due on the session date, before any photography 
				actually begins.   Client will receive deliverables under this Agreement approximately 1 week 
				after the session date.  This is only an estimate, however, and is not binding in any way.  
				4.   Cancellations/Rescheduling.   Cancellations and requests to reschedule will be treated according 
				to the terms outlined in this section.  
				a.   Cancellations/Rescheduling by Client:  If Client cancels, then Photographer keeps the 
				Deposit.  If Client requests to reschedule, Photographer similarly keeps the Deposit and has 
				no obligation to reschedule.  However, if Client wishes to reschedule because of illness or 
				family emergency, then Photographer will attempt to accommodate the request to reschedule 
				by proposing one make-up date/time to Client.  The determination of what is an acceptable 
				illness or family emergency is in Photographer’s sole discretion.  Further, this make-up 
				date/time is in Photographer’s sole discretion.  If Client cannot attend this make-up date/time, 
				then Photographer has no further obligations to Client and Photographer also keeps the 
				Deposit.  
				b.   Cancellations/Rescheduling by Photographer:  If Photographer needs to cancel or reschedule, 
				and Client cannot accommodate any alternative date/time, then the Deposit will be returned 
				to Client and Photographer does not need to perform the Services outlined in this Agreement.  
				c.    Cancellations/Rescheduling due to Inclement Weather: If inclement weather makes it 
				unreasonable for the Photographer and Client to meet, then Photographer and Client will make reasonable efforts to reschedule.  Light rain does not constitute inclement weather. If 
				the Photographer and Client cannot agree on a make-up date/time after one month from the 
				original session date, Photographer keeps the Deposit and has no further obligations under 
				this Agreement.
				5.   Copyright.   Photographer retains all copyright in any and all works created pursuant to this 
				Agreement, in any and all formats (“Work”).  Photographer grants to Client a limited, non-
				transferable, non-exclusive license to display the Work for personal, non-commercial purposes.  
				Client may not use the Work for any other purpose, including but not limited to use for financial 
				gain, advertising, editorial purposes, contests, exhibits, or commercial reasons.  Any display of 
				the Work on the internet or on social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.) must 
				be accompanied by a caption designating Photographer as the owner of the work.  Nothing in this 
				Agreement shall be construed as forming a “work for hire” relationship between Photographer 
				and Client.  Client’s license is limited solely to displaying the Work for personal, non-commercial 
				purposes.  Accordingly, Client may not edit the Work in any way, including but not limited to 
				modifying colors, writing on the Work, or significantly cropping the Work.   
				6.   Formats That Work Will Be Provided to Client.  Photographer will make the Work available to 
				Client in the formats listed in this section.  Photographer has no obligation to keep the Work after 
				making Work available to Client, and may destroy the Work at any time thereafter.  It is Client’s 
				responsibility to preserve the Work.   
				7.   Releases.  Client grants Photographer permission to photograph the people listed in this 
				Agreement, and does not object to the Work being displayed on Photographer’s website or 
				promotional materials. Client represents it has the authority to provide the foregoing consents on 
				behalf of the people being photographed, including any minors.   
				8.   Independent Contractor Relationship.   Photographer is an independent contractor, and not an 
				employee of Client.  Photographer is allowed to provide photography services to other individuals 
				and businesses.    Photographer also is allowed to subcontract all or part of its obligations under 
				this Agreement to other individuals or businesses.  Further, Client recognizes that photography 
				encompasses a high degree of artistic subjectivity and discretion, and Client agrees to any and all 
				artistic choices made by Photographer and/or its affiliates.
				9.   Other Provisions.   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, without 
				regards to any conflict of law provisions.  Further, any action or dispute arising out of or in any 
				way relating to this Agreement shall be heard exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in 
				Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania.  This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties.  
				No oral agreements shall be given any effect.  Modifications to this Agreement are not binding 
				unless the modifications are in writing and signed by both parties.  The Photographer’s failure to 
				enforce one part of this Agreement shall not prevent it from enforcing any other part of this 
				Agreement. If one part of this Agreement is found invalid, the rest of the Agreement stands.  
				Photographer is in no way liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or 
				exemplary damages, and the maximum damages Client may recover (if any) is the Total Amount
